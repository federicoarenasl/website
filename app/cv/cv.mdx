### Senior AI Engineer (11/2025 → Present), AI Engineer (04/2024 → 11/2025) — [materiom.org](https://materiom.org/)

Funded by Google, end-to-end development of production-ready AI software for bio-based materials, focusing on generative AI, LLMs, integrating tools and knowledge bases from materials science and biochemistry:
- **[Materiom AI](https://commons.materiom.org/materiom-ai): Agentic RAG application with access to 40000+ materials** and various search APIs, serving 10000+ user sessions since its deployment, and 10+ entreprise partnerships.
- **[Materiom Commons](https://commons.materiom.org): web-based platform accelerating bio-based material innovation**, catering to 25000+ registered users across 130 countries with 99.99% uptime.
- **Neural models for material synthesis and material property prediction** trained on experimental data from partner scientific labs across the world. Trialed with multiple entreprise partners.
- **Evaluation pipelines** for automated, continuous model monitoring in production, including expert-led metrics to enable rapid diagnostics and model improvement.
- **Engaged in key investor and partner events** to expand our customer
base and establish strategic partnerships in Europe, the US, and the UK.

Stack: GCP; Cloud Run, PGVector, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, FastAPI, Python, ADK, Langfuse, PyTorch, React, TypeScript.

### AI Engineer (09/2021 → 04/2024) — [conode.ai](https://conode.ai/)

Led the design, development, and deployment of cloud-based AI-human collaboration features at Conode (previously dRISK):

- [**Enterprise Data Solution**](https://app.conode.ai/): web app built with TypeScript, Rust, and Python, enabling non-technical decision-makers to navigate and understand large datasets graphically.
- [**AV Perception Retraining Platform**](https://www.conode.ai/post/adding-color-and-texture-to-machine-learning-development-using-edge): Allows users to graphically identify and fix perception failures through data curation, model retraining, fine-tuning, and performance tracking.
- **LLM-Powered Agent**: Enables non-technical users to interact with data exploration tools via natural language, hosted on a Python Flask server with websocket communication.
- **Led multiple customer-facing projects from PoC to mature relationships** with major
clients like NVIDIA, Luminar, TATA Motors, SAE and others.
- **Engaged in key investor events** to expand our customer base and form strategic partnerships, especially in SE Asia and the UK.

Stack: Rust, PyTorch, Flask, Python, React, TypeScript.

### ML Engineer (06/2021 → 09/2021) — [neurolabs.ai](https://www.neurolabs.ai/)
Led the exploration for learned Synthetic Data Generation methods integrated into their Retail Product. Resulted in a Distinction-grade thesis. Read more [here](https://github.com/federicoarenasl/unsupervised-sdg-using-unity/tree/develop).
