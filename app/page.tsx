        I wear many hats; Fullstack Software Engineering, ML Engineering, more 
        broadly AI Engineering, or you'll also see me launching AI products inside 
        startups.

        {`I'm not just that of course, I dabble on the guitar, currently 
        focusing on Classical Brasilian Guitar. I also like to read books, with a soft bias 
        for philosophy, magic realism, and a sprinkle of business/startup books here
         and there. Oh and I also like running.

        This page will constantly evolve, so please see this as that.
