So I hear blogging is back on the rise. So I hear the power is back in our hands. The power to take back what the internet once gave us: freedom of expression for creators and builders, devoid of larger forces controlling our incentives.

So I hear AI is returning to the builders. So I hear this technology has been misused and monopolized. So I hear we have the power to change this. So I hear AI can be of great good.

So I hear there are others like me; thus I am encouraged to join them.
